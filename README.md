# Personal Website & Blog

## To upload posts

---

Use Git to commit to a Github/GitLab repo. Then have a CD pipeline pull from the repo & deploy changes to the production website.

The site & repo should be configured in such a way that adding a post in a "Posts" Folder:

- Adds an card snippet to the list of posts on the homepage
- Creates a path/url to the post
- Provide a full page html page for the post
